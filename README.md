# MANNED MISSILE MASTER
A project made in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 43 Compo.


Lets put realism aside and say, “don’t you think it would be fun to pilot a missile and crash into things?” In this game, you play as pilots of the AAGSS-69 Manoman. The AAGSS-69 Manoman is a missile that does not use a conventional guidance system, but instead features a cockpit containing a pilot.

 * Missiles move with extreme realism
 * Missiles fly through missile shaped holes
 * Unmanned missiles get hit by manned missiles

Includes 5 levels:

 * Operation Unskilled Pilot
 * De-Automation
 * Operation Boring Game
 * Solid Moisture
 * Operation Operation

This version of the game was modified after LD43 to fix an issue with the sky being dark.
